# Introduction of DevOps

- DevOps is the combination of two words , one is **development** and other is **Operations**.

- This allows a single team to handle the entire application life cycle, from development to testing, deployment, and operations.

- DevOps promotes collaboration between Development and Operations team to deploy code to production faster in an automated & repeatable way.

- **DevOps is nothing but a practice or methodology of making **"Developers"** and **"Operations"** folks work together.
- DevOps represents a change in the IT culture with a complete focus on rapid IT service delivery through the adoption of agile practices in the context of a system- oriented approach.
- DevOps is all about the integration of the operations and development process. Organizations that have adopted DevOps noticed a 22% improvement in software quality and a 17% improvement in application deployment frequency and achieve a 22% hike in customer satisfaction. 19% of revenue hikes as a result of the successful DevOps implementation

# Why DevOps

- The operation and development team worked in complete isolation.
- Manual code deployment leads to human errors in production.

- Without the use of DevOps, the team members are spending a large amount of time on designing, testing, and deploying instead of building the project.

# DevOps Lifecycle

## **Continuous Development**

- This phase involves the planning and coding of the software. 
- The vision of the project is decided during the planning phase. 
- And the developers begin developing the code for the application.
- There are no DevOps tools that are required for planning, but there are several tools for maintaining the code.

## **Continuous Integration**
- This stage is the heart of the entire DevOps life cycle.
- It is a software development practice in which the developers require to commit changes to the source code more frequently.
-  This may be on a daily or weekly basis. 
-  Then every commit is built, and this allows early detection of problems if they are present. 
-  Building code is not only involved compilation, but it also includes unit testing, integration testing, code review, and packaging.


# Docker Introduction

- Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
- Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.
- With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.

## Containers
- A container is a runnable instance of an image. 
- You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI.
- You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state.

# Introduction to Jenkins

- Jenkins is a popular tool used in this phase.
- Whenever there is a change in the Git repository, then Jenkins fetches the updated code and prepares a build of that code, which is an executable file in the form of war or jar.
- Then this build is forwarded to the test server or the production server.

## Continuous Testing

- This phase, where the developed software is continuously testing for bugs. 
- For constant testing, automation testing tools such as **TestNG**, **JUnit** , **Selenium** , etc are used. These tools allow QAs to test multiple code-bases thoroughly in parallel to ensure that there is no flaw in the functionality.
-  In this phase, **Docker** Containers can be used for simulating the test environment.

# Introduction to Selenium
**Selenium does the automation testing, and TestNG generates the reports. This entire testing phase can automate with the help of a Continuous Integration tool called Jenkins.**

## Continuous Monitoring

- Monitoring is a phase that involves all the operational factors of the entire DevOps process, where important information about the use of the software is recorded and carefully processed to find out trends and identify problem areas.  
-  Usually, the monitoring is integrated within the operational capabilities of the software application.

## Continuous Feedback

- The application development is consistently improved by analyzing the results from the operations of the software.
-  This is carried out by placing the critical phase of constant feedback between the operations and the development of the next version of the current software application.

- The continuity is the essential factor in the DevOps as it removes the unnecessary steps which are required to take a software application from development, using it to find out its issues and then producing a better version. - - It kills the efficiency that may be possible with the app and reduce the number of interested customers.

## Continuous Deployment

In this phase, the code is deployed to the production servers. Also, it is essential to ensure that the

Code is correctly used on all the servers.


## Continuous Operations

- All DevOps operations are based on the continuity with complete automation of the release process and allow the organization to accelerate the overall time to market continuingly.
- It is clear from the discussion that continuity is the critical factor in the DevOps in removing steps that often distract the development, take it longer to detect issues and produce a better version of the product after several months. With DevOps, we can make any software product more efficient and increase the overall count of interested customers in your product.

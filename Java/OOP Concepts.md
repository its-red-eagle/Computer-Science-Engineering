Object-Oriented Programming
➢ Principles Of Object-Oriented Programming
		• Principles	of	Object-Oriented	programming	are	
			• 1.Abstraction.	
			• 2.Encapsulation.	
			• 3.Inheritance.	
			• 4.Polymorphism

1.Abstraction	
	Abstraction	means	hiding	internal	details	and	showing	the	required	
	things.
	For Example:
	Consider a man driving a car, while driving he focus on using of steering, gear,
	accelerator etc.
	He does not require to know the inner mechanism of the car.			

2.Encapsulation	
	Encapsulation	is	the	process	of	grouping	data	in	a	single	section
	For	Example: 		
	Complete	television	is	single	box	where	all	the	mechanism	are	hidden	inside	the	
	box	all	are	capsuled

3. Inheritance	
	Inheritance	means	designing	an	object	or	a	class	by	re-using	the	
	properties	of	the	existing	class	and	object.
	Inheritance	is	same	as	specialization.	
	For	Example:	
	A	old	style	television	(idiot	box)	is	transformed	with	extra	features	into	slim	and	
	smart	television	where	it	re-used	the	properties	of	old	television.

4. Polymorphism	
Polymorphism	is	a	concept	in	which	we	can	execute	a	single	
operation	in	different	ways.
Polymorphism	is	same	as	generalization.

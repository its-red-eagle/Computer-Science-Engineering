**<h1 align="center">Object-Oriented Programming</h1>**<br><br>

In this article, we will learn about the basics of OOPs. Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts, such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism, etc.

**Simula** is considered the first object-oriented programming language.

➢ **Principles Of Object-Oriented Programming** <br>
		• Principles	of	Object-Oriented	programming	are: <br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.Abstraction.	<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.Encapsulation.	<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.Inheritance.	<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.Polymorphism<br>
<br>
**1.Abstraction**<br>
	Abstraction	means	hiding	internal	details	and	showing	the	required	
	things.
	_For Example:_
	_Consider a man driving a car, while driving he focus on using of steering, gear,
	accelerator etc.
	He does not require to know the inner mechanism of the car.			_

**2.Encapsulation**	<br>
	Encapsulation	is	the	process	of	grouping	data	in	a	single	section
	_For	Example: 		
	Complete	television	is	single	box	where	all	the	mechanism	are	hidden	inside	the	
	box	all	are	capsuled_

**3. Inheritance**<br>	
	Inheritance	means	designing	an	object	or	a	class	by	re-using	the	
	properties	of	the	existing	class	and	object.
	Inheritance	is	same	as	specialization.	
	For	Example:	
	A	old	style	television	(idiot	box)	is	transformed	with	extra	features	into	slim	and	
	smart	television	where	it	re-used	the	properties	of	old	television.

**4. Polymorphism** <br>
Polymorphism	is	a	concept	in	which	we	can	execute	a	single	
operation	in	different	ways.
Polymorphism	is	same	as	generalization.

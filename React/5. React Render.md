# React Render

React's goal is in many ways to render HTML in a web page.

React renders HTML to the web page by using a function called `ReactDOM.render()`.

## Render Function

`ReactDOM.render()` function takes two arguments, HTML code and an HTML element.
The purpose of the function is to display the specified HTML code inside the specified HTML element.
But render where?

There is another folder in the root directory of your React project, named `public`. In this folder, there is an `index.html` file.
```
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
```
We can notice a single `<div>` in the body of this file. This is where our React application will be rendered.
```
ReactDOM.render(<p>Hello</p>, document.getElementById('root'));
```

Now if the above code intrigues you as we have written write HTML tags inside the JavaScript code, then move to the next module to learn about JSX or JavaScript XML files.

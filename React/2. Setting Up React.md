# Setting up a React Environment

If you have npx and Node.js installed, you can create a React application by using `create-react-app`

## Example
Run this command to create a React application named my-react-app:<br><br>
`npx create-react-app my-react-app`

# Run the React Application

Run this command to move to the my-react-app directory:<br><br>
`cd my-react-app`

Run this command to run the React application my-react-app:<br><br>
`npm start`

A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App!

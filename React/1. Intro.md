# Introduction to React.Js

- React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components.
- It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.

# How does React work ?

- React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.

- Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.

- React only changes what needs to be changed! React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed. 

To get an overview of what React is, you can write React code directly in HTML.

# React Directly in HTML
Start by including three scripts, the first two let us write React code in our JavaScripts, and the third, Babel, allows us to write JSX syntax and ES6 in older browsers.

## Example
Include three CDN's in your HTML file:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>

    <div id="mydiv"></div>

    <script type="text/babel">
      function Hello() {
        return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
      }

      ReactDOM.render(<Hello />, document.getElementById('mydiv'))
    </script>

  </body>
</html>
```
This way of using React can be OK for testing purposes, but for production you will need to set up a React environment.

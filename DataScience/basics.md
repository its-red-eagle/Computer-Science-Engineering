What is Data Science?

Data science is the multidisciplinary field that focuses on finding actionable information in large, raw or structured data sets to identify patterns and uncover other insights. The field primarily seeks to discover answers for areas that are unknown and unexpected.

Data science is more concerned with establishing questions to ask based on existing data than immediately applicable BI insights, preferring to locate potential trends and new avenues of exploration instead of immediately actionable answers.

In practice, data science analytics explores large amounts of raw data seeking possible patterns that may lead to more concrete questions, looking for correlations or connections in disparate datasets and even exploring better ways to find solutions for problems that havenâ€™t even been considered yet.

## Scripting languages
Scripting languages solve smaller programming issues and can be used to write operating system utilities. Examples include Perl, PHP, JavaScript and Python.

## Declarative languages
Declarative languages tell a computer what needs to be done without including instructions for how to complete the task. This type of language can be classified as a logic programming or functional language, as they all help a computer to solve problems in programming. Examples include Prolog, Lisp, ML and Haskell.

## Document formatting languages
Document formatting languages organize printed text and graphics, and some function similarly to a word processor. Examples include TeX, PostScript and SGML.

Front end development languages are used to code the visual aspects of websites, games, software and apps. Examples include HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Database programming languages
Database programming languages help to create databases and manipulate the way data is stored inside them. Examples include C++, COBOL, Java and Perl.

## Rule-based languages
Rule-based languages implement rules once they are activated by certain conditions in a data set. Examples include AWK, CLIPS, Prolog and Wolfram Language.

## Compiled languages
Compiled languages have been translated by computer programs from one programming language to another and convert information directly to code, which streamlines the programming process. Examples include ActionScript, Ballerina, C++ and ALGOL.

## Back end coding languages
Back end coding languages code program servers so that web pages appear and function correctly. Examples include Python, Java and Ruby.

## System languages
System languages can complete tasks like memory management or task management when programming an entire system. Examples include Swift, Rust, C++ and Nim.

## Algorithmic languages
Algorithmic languages convey mathematical or symbolic computations and can use algebraic operations to convey information. Examples include Fortran, ALGOL, Lisp and C.

## Command-line interface languages
Command-line interface languages use lines of text to send commands to computer programs. Examples include Batch, CLIST, TACL and 4DOS.

## Computational languages
Computational languages declaratively communicate the logic and functions of a computer command. Examples include Wolfram Language, Gremlin, QML and Mercury.

## Visual languages
Visual languages specify programs in two-dimensional ways through different types of graphic layouts. Examples include Grasshopper, GameMaker Language, XOD and ToonTalk.

## XML-based languages
XML, or Extensible Markup Language, encodes documents in a way that can be read and understood by both people and computers and exists across the internet. Examples include Apache Ant, MXML, ECMAScript for XML and XQuery.

## Syntax handling languages
Syntax handling languages generate analyzers that convert character sequences to token sequences that have specified meanings for context-free grammar. Examples include ANTLR, lex, Prolog and JavaCC.

## Interpreted languages
Interpreted languages enable programs to be executed from source code with the help of an interpreter, rather than being compiled. Examples include Apache Ant, JavaScript, PostScript and Windows PowerShell.

## Little languages
Little languages help to manage a specialized problem domain, such as text formatting, combinations and resource allocation. Examples include AWK, Comet, sed and SQL.

## Metaprogramming languages
Metaprogramming languages write programs that write and edit other programs. Examples include C++, META II, Python and TREEMETA.

## Esoteric languages
Esoteric languages test unorthodox methods of programming language design, such as using a fictional language as a basis for a program. Examples include Beatnik, INTERCAL, Piet and Whitespace.

## Non-English-based languages
Non-English-based programming languages take keywords from languages other than English to create commands. Examples include Chinese BASIC, Lexico, Rapira and ezhil.

## Curly-bracket languages
Curly-bracket languages use curly brackets or brace characters to define statement blocks. Examples include AWK, Ballerina, C++ and ECMAScript.

## Off-side rule languages
Off-side rule languages designate blocks of code based on their indentation. Examples include ISWIM, ABC, Python and Elixir.

## Iterative languages
Iterative languages are built around generators that solve smaller instances of a certain problem to inform how they can solve the original problem and generate a certain outcome. Examples include Aldor, Eiffel, Julia and Python.

## Constraint programming languages
Constraint programming languages fall under declarative programming language and express relationships between their variables as constraints. Examples include MiniZinc, Oz and Kaleidoscope.

## Numerical analysis languages
Numerical analysis languages are mainly used for technical computing. Examples include Wolfram Language, Analytica, Fortran and MATLAB.

## Multiparadigm languages
Multiparadigm languages allow a program to use multiple programming styles to work at once in a single program and combine constructs from different programming languages. Examples include ALF, C++, ECMAScript and Python.

## Embeddable languages
Embeddable languages are used in source code, for servers and by clients to embed code into free-form text. Examples include PHP, VBScript, ActionScript and JavaScript.

## Imperative languages
Imperative languages convey information to computers through serial orders and large amounts of detail. They might also fall under other classifications as multiparadigm programming languages. Examples include MATLAB, ECMAScript, Perl and Python.

## Dataflow languages
Dataflow languages use a representation of the exchange of data to specify programs and process streams of data. Examples include Analytica, Lucid, Oz and Ballerina.

## Authoring languages
Authoring languages help to create interactive computer programs, such as tutorials or websites. Examples include Lasso, PILOT, TUTOR and Authorware.

## Extension languages
Extension languages are embedded into other programs to use their features in extension scripts. Examples include JavaScipt, Perl, Squirrel and CAL.

## Hardware description languages
Hardware description languages describe the design, structure and operation of electronic and digital logic circuits. Examples include Verilog, VHDL, Java and Ruby.

## Macro languages
Macro languages can be for application or textual substitution to change one source code file into another, often in order to preprocess source code. Examples include C++, m4 and ML/I.
